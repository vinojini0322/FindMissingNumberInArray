You have given an integer array which contains numbers from 1 to 100 but one number is missing.
You need to write a Java program to find that missing number in an array. 

<h4>Input array: 
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18}
</h4>
   
<h3>Missing number:
    16
</h3>

Trick to solve this problem is to calculate sum of all numbers in the array and compare with 
expected sum, the difference would be the missing number.
